# Machine Learning Algorithms

A visual representation of various ML algorithms built with Python and Pygame.

## Algorithms Implemented
* **Linear Regression:** A visualizer that calculates the line of best fit ($y = mx + b$) based on user-placed points.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x and the Pygame library installed.
```bash
pip install pygame
python Visualizer.py
